This is the user interface project for VSCP

testphp
=======

The testfiles for apache + PHP is in the testphp folder

Remember that all folders must be accessable by the webserver. For apache this
is usally www-data but check this in /etc/apache2/envvars Check for 
APACHE_RUN_USER= and make sure that this user have privileges to access this
folder and all subfolder. Start to make sure that the index.php file in this
folder runs.

Configure apache tso it see this folder. This is 

Alias /merlin/ "/home/akhe/vscp_merlin/"
<Directory "/home/akhe/vscp_merlin/">
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    	Order allow,deny
    	Allow from all
</Directory>

on my machine. You find this file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default


testws
======

The testws interface is some tests for the VSCP daemon websocket interface.

To test first set the the web root path of the VSCP daemon to this folder. 
On my machine this is /home/akhe/vscp_merlin. 

In the configuration file this is set as

<!-- Path to server root file system -->
<!-- Server should have read/write access to this location -->
<webrootpath>/home/akhe/vscp_merlin</webrootpath>

Remember to restart the daemon if you change the configuration file.

To test that everything is working enter

http://localhost:7681/testws/index.html

and you should get the startpage.
