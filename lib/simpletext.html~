<p> The <i>vscpws_simpleText</i> is just formatted text that can be displayed on a web page. 
 It does not sound very exciting but it is. The text can be a dynamically updated temperature value
  o≈ï some other measurement which is formatted nicely as you have all formatting capabilities of
  HTML5 at your disposal. You can display information from received events or data from a VSCP daemon variable.
