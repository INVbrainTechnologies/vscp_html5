 
Flaming Pear Icons: Sets 1, 2, 3

All these icons may be used without restriction; sets 1 and 2 were created with a minimum of anger and despair by using Knot. Set 3 was made using BladePro; both programs are from Flaming Pear Software at www.flamingpear.com .

CD-ROM makers who wish to distribute this collection may do so if they notify Lloyd Burchill, lloyd@kagi.com.
