<h1>vscpws_simpleText</h1>

<p><i>This information is preliminary and can change at any time.</i></p>

<img src="../images/floorplan_button_example.png" align="right">
<p> The <i>vscpws_simpleText</i> is just formatted dynamic text that can be displayed on a web page. 
 It does not sound very exciting but it is. In the past Ajax was used for this and
 the server was polled for data. Here websockets are used giving a much more lightway
 data handling. The text can be a dynamically updated temperature value
  o≈ï some other measurement which is formatted nicely as you have all formatting capabilities of
  HTML5 at your disposal. You can display information from received events or data from a 
  VSCP daemon variable.    
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<pre>        
        vscpws_simpleText( url,             // url to VSCP websocket i/f
                            id,             // Where it should be placed 
                            vscpclass,      // VSCP event class e.g. 10/60/65/15
                            vscptype,       // VSCP Event type
                            sensorindex,    // Datacoding index
                            decimals,       // Number of decimals
                            formatstr,      // A value format string
                            guid,           // GUID we are interested in
                            index,          // Index if applicable
                            zone,           // Zone if applicable
                            subzone,        // Subzone if applicable
                            fncallback )    // If set function to call
                                            // when data arrives
</pre>

<h3>url</h3>

This is the url to the websocket server. This typically is on the form
<pre>            "ws://192.168.1.20:7681"<br>        </pre>

With all widgets having there own url specified for the websocket
server it is possible to create web pages that control
nodes/units/hardware that are located in different locations from the
same page.

<h3>id</h3>
This is the id for the HTML element where the result should be placed. This can 
be any HTML element which can display text and all formating capabilities of HTML
can obviously be used.

<h3>vscpclass</h3>
This is the the VSCP class of the event we are interested in. Normally this is 
one of the measurement events which have all SI units and more 
(usually derived units) specified. Set to -1 for don't care.

<h3>vscptype</h3>
This is the the VSCP type of the event we are interested in. Set to -1 for don't care.

<h3>sensorindex</h3>
This is the sensor index for the sensor in the device sending out the event. 
This information is part of the datacoding and can be a value 0,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7.
Set to -1 for don't care.

<h3>decimals</h3>
Number of decimals in the displayed value. Default is two. If you use a callback
the

<h3>formatstr</h3>
This is a string that can be used to format the value before it is written to the
HTML element. The string have a format on this form
<pre>
            "{0} degrees Celsius"
</pre>
where the escapes in {n} will be replaced by real time data.
<ul>
<li>0 - Measurement value (e.g "-12.5".</li>
<li>1 - Measurement unit in real text form (e.g. "Celsius", "Fahrenheit" etc).</li>
<li>2 - Measurement unit in numerical form (e.g. "0", "1", "2" etc).</li>
<li>3 - Sensor index (e.g. "0", "1", "2").</li>
</ul>

<h3>guid</h3>
This can be used to match a specific GUID the event should come from. Default is
"" meaning events from all sensors are of interest.

<h3>index</h3>
This can be used to match a specific index. Default is -1 meaning don't care. Only
VSCP_CLASS1_MEASUREZONE and VSCP_CLASS1_SETVALUEZONE have an index to check among
the meaurement classes.

<h3>zone</h3>
This can be used to match a specific zone. Default is -1 meaning don't care. Only
VSCP_CLASS1_MEASUREZONE and VSCP_CLASS1_SETVALUEZONE have a zone to check among
the measurement classes.

<h3>subzone</h3>
This can be used to match a specific subzone. Default is -1 meaning don't care. Only
VSCP_CLASS1_MEASUREZONE and VSCP_CLASS1_SETVALUEZONE have a subzone to check among
the measurement classes.

<h3>fncallback</h3>
Here it is possible to enter a user defined function that get the value, the unit
and the full event as its arguments. 
<pre>
            userfunc(value,unit,event)
</pre>
This function should return a string that is what will be written to the HTML page.

<h2>Using the widget</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a temperature sensor like the 
    <a href="http://www.auto.grodansparadis.com/kelvinntc10k/kelvin_ntc10ka.html">Kelvin NTC</a> which sends out
 events on common intervals. For this device you will get events like
<pre>
        VSCP CLASS = 10 i.e. CLASS1.MEASUREMENT we have a measurement event.

        VSCP Type = 6 Telling that this is a temperature measurement.

        DATA = 0x8A,0x02,0x09,0x72 telling that this is data from sensor 2 and that 
                                     the temperature now is +24.18 degrees Celsius.
</pre>
If you are interested in the format and want to understand it please see the specification 
<a href="http://vscp.org/vscpspec/vscp_spec_latest.xhtml#magicparlabel-3967" target="new">section 8</a>
</p>
<p>
This display this value in a HTML page we can insert a line like this
</p>
<pre>
<div>    
    This is just some text in a div where a temperature is equal to &lt;span id="id1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
    is displayed in-line in the text. 
</div>
</pre>
<p>Nothing to fancy. The "id1" is the interesting part here. This where the temperature value 
  will be placed. Naturally this span-element can have all attributes a HTML element can have. Also
it can be any other HTML element. To display values from sensor 2 we insert this code </p>
<pre>
<script type="text/javascript" >
       
	var txt1 = new vscpws_simpleTextEvent( "ws://192.168.1.20:7681", 
                                            "id1", 
                                            VSCP_CLASS1_MEASUREMENT,
                                            VSCP_TYPE_MEASUREMENT_TEMPERATURE,
                                            2 );
	
</script>
</pre>
<p>Thats is all that is needed. A live web page is now available that updates the
temperature with the interval set when configurating the sensor. </p>       
<p>You can add a format string if you want to change the apperance for the output.
 Add a line to the above to look like this instead</p>
<pre>
<script type="text/javascript" >
	var txt1 = new vscpws_simpleTextEvent( "ws://192.168.1.20:7681", 
                                            "id1", 
                                            VSCP_CLASS1_MEASUREMENT,
                                            VSCP_TYPE_MEASUREMENT_TEMPERATURE,
                                            2,
                                            "{0} degrees celsius");	
</script>
</pre>
<p> put in any text you like. {0} is the temperature value. There are other 
    things you can add also. For example {1} is the unit symbol for the 
    measurement. </p>
